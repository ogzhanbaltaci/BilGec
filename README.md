# BilGec
BilGec is a game where you play as a fox. Main goal of the game is facing enemies that are scattered throughout the levels, 
answering the questions they asked correctly and as a result beating them. 
Additionally you need to find and collect gems to unlock level exit portal. If you run straight to the portal without collecting the gems then the portal wont open so you need to go back and explore the levels to find gems. My game consists of 6 levels that get harder as you progress. 

On this project i tried to use everything i have learned from my previous game projects to make a game that is enjoyable and  instructs the player about general knowledge topics that consists of geography, maths, history, biology etc.
Upon completion the person is expected to have developed himself/herself in simple general knowledge topics.

You can watch the first episode of the game from down below.

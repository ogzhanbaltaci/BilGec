# BilGec
BilGec is a game where you play as a fox. I have created this game for my school graduation project. Main goal of the game is facing enemies that are scattered throughout the levels, answering the questions they asked true and as a result beating them. 
Additionally you need to find and collect gems to unlock level exit portal. If you run straight to the portal without collecting the gems then the portal wont open so you need to go back and explore the levels to find gems. The game consists of 6 levels that gets harder each time.
